# Technical References

This directory will contain reference documentation for the various technologies used in the Journal App project.

## Planned Reference Documentation

As the project progresses, this directory will be populated with reference materials for:

- **React Native**: Component architecture, navigation patterns, and styling best practices
- **Expo**: Environment setup, workflow, and SDK features
- **TensorFlow Lite**: Model integration, optimization, and usage
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Coding standards and best practices
- **UI/UX**: Design patterns and implementation guides

## Purpose of References

Unlike guides which provide step-by-step instructions, reference documentation serves as a quick lookup resource for:

1. Implementation details
2. Code examples
3. API specifications
4. Configuration options
5. Best practices

## Contributing to References

When adding reference documentation:

- Organize by technology or topic
- Include both basic and advanced usage examples
- Link to official documentation where appropriate
- Keep content concise and well-structured

## Status

This section is under development and will be expanded as the project progresses beyond the planning phase into implementation.
