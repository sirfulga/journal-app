## About GitHub Workflow

The Journal App project uses two primary workflows for repository management:

1. **Local Git Workflow**: Traditional Git commands for batch updates
   - Clone repository
   - Make changes locally
   - Commit and push changes

2. **GitHub API Workflow**: Direct file-by-file updates via API
   - Useful for single file updates
   - No local repository required

The sync script referenced in these guides helps automate the process of keeping the GitHub repository updated with changes from a local development directory.
