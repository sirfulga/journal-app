# Journal App: Context

This document contains additional context, technical considerations, and future plans for the Journal App development.

## Technical Considerations

### On-Device AI Processing
- TensorFlow Lite will be used for core AI features:
  - Grammar and punctuation correction
  - Basic formatting assistance
  - Simple text clarity improvements
  - Identification of thoughts, goals, objectives, and tasks within user input
- TensorFlow Lite limitations:
  - Limited model size and complexity
  - Focused on specific, well-defined tasks
  - Not suitable for complex analysis or generation
- TensorFlow models will be prompted separately for each specific function:
  - Grammar correction
  - Formatting
  - Thought/goal/objective/task identification

### Audio Processing
- Voice-to-text conversion requires:
  - Reliable speech recognition capabilities
  - Handling of different accents and speech patterns
  - Efficient processing with minimal battery drain
- Consider integration with platform-specific APIs for optimal performance

### Multi-Language Support
- Evaluate TensorFlow Lite capabilities for multi-language processing
- If TensorFlow Lite has limited multi-language support:
  - Begin with a single language for the Minimum Testable Product
  - Plan for future integration with more robust multi-language AI services
- Consider language-specific models versus universal models

### Environment Configuration
- Implement a .env file for:
  - API keys
  - Service credentials
  - Environment-specific configuration
  - Feature flags
- Ensure proper security practices for sensitive information

### Repository Management
- The project is managed in a GitHub repository at https://github.com/sirfulga/journal-app
- Two methods are available for updating the repository:
  1. **Local Git workflow**: Traditional Git commands for batch updates
  2. **GitHub API**: Direct file-by-file updates via API
- A sync script (`sync.sh`) is provided to easily sync between development and GitHub:
  - Automatically pulls latest changes from GitHub
  - Syncs content from local development directory
  - Commits and pushes changes back to GitHub
  - Handles both documentation and code files
- See the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file in the repository for detailed workflow instructions

## Project Structure

### Application Architecture
- Each page/screen will have its own dedicated folder
- Separate files for:
  - UI components
  - Logic/functionality
  - Styling
  - Tests
- AI functionality will be isolated in dedicated files/modules for easier maintenance
- Screenshots will guide structural design (not visual design)
- All screens should be interconnected according to the navigation flow demonstrated in screenshots

### Folder Organization
- `/screens` - Individual app screens
- `/components` - Reusable UI components
- `/services` - AI and other service integrations
- `/utils` - Helper functions
- `/assets` - Images, fonts, etc.
- `/styles` - Global styles and themes
- `/navigation` - Navigation configuration
- `/localization` - Multi-language support files

## Development Phases

### Version 0.1 - Minimum Testable Product (MTP)
- Core focus:
  - Main dashboard/landing page
  - Journal entry creation screen
  - Basic TensorFlow Lite integration
- Primary AI functionality:
  - Grammar correction
  - Pagination
  - Text formatting
- This phase will validate the core concept and technical feasibility

### Version 0.2 - Complete Structural Implementation
- Implementation of all app screens and pages
- Full navigation flow between screens
- Basic UI for all sections
- Structural components in place, even if not all functionality is implemented

## Future Development Phases

This section outlines potential future development phases after the initial MVP:

1. Enhanced AI capabilities
2. Multi-platform enhancements  
3. Cloud synchronization options
4. Analytics and insights
5. Social integration
6. Premium feature development

## Future Premium Features

While the core app will remain free and fully functional, several premium features may be considered for future monetization:

1. Advanced AI analysis
2. Cloud storage and sync
3. Enhanced voice-to-text
4. Theme customization
5. Advanced export options
6. Multi-device sync

### Advanced Goal Analysis
- This feature will require more powerful language models beyond TensorFlow Lite
- The system will:
  - Analyze journal entries over time
  - Identify patterns in user's thoughts, goals, and activities
  - Intelligently suggest tasks and objectives to help users progress
  - Provide insights into goal achievement patterns
- Implementation considerations:
  - May require cloud-based processing for more powerful models
  - Will need careful privacy design to protect sensitive journal content
  - Could be offered as a premium subscription feature

### User Experience Evolution

#### Phase 1 (v0.1) - Minimum Testable Product
- Basic journaling functionality
- On-device AI assistance with TensorFlow Lite
- Text and audio input methods
- Simple organization tools

#### Phase 2 (v0.2) - Complete Structure
- All screens implemented
- Full navigation structure
- Basic UI for all sections
- Foundational architecture in place

#### Phase 3 (v1.0) - Enhanced Experience
- Advanced organization and tagging
- Improved AI assistance capabilities
- Cross-device synchronization
- Enhanced privacy features

#### Phase 4 (v2.0) - Premium Features
- Advanced goal analysis and suggestions
- Cloud-based processing for more powerful AI features
- Extended insights and analytics
- Additional premium customization options

## Privacy and Data Considerations
- Default approach: maximize on-device processing
- Premium features may require optional cloud processing
- Clear user consent and control over data usage
- Consider offering fully offline mode vs. enhanced cloud mode

## Development Priorities
1. Core journaling experience with clean UI
2. Basic TensorFlow Lite integration for text assistance
3. Voice-to-text input capability
4. Organization and cataloging tools
5. Testing and refinement of core experience
6. Premium feature development
