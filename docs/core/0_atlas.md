# Journal App Documentation Atlas

## Overview

This document serves as the central navigation guide for all documentation related to the Journal App project. It provides a comprehensive map of where to find specific information and how different documentation components relate to each other. When working with the Journal App project, this should be your first point of reference.

## Core Documentation Sequence

The core documentation follows a deliberate progression from high-level concepts to implementation details:

1. **WHY** - [1_[why]_purpose.md](./1_[why]_purpose.md)
   - Project vision and core purpose
   - Target audience and user needs
   - Value proposition and key benefits

2. **WHAT** - [2_[what]_product_specification.md](./2_[what]_product_specification.md)
   - Comprehensive feature requirements
   - User interface specifications
   - Functional and non-functional requirements
   - User stories and use cases

3. **HOW** - [3_[how]_context.md](./3_[how]_context.md)
   - Technical approach and architecture
   - Implementation constraints
   - Technical decisions and rationale
   - Privacy and security considerations
   - GitHub repository information

4. **WHEN** - [4_[when]_action_plan.md](./4_[when]_action_plan.md)
   - Development roadmap and timeline
   - Version milestones (v0.1, v0.2, etc.)
   - Task breakdown and priorities
   - Development phases

5. **WITH** - [5_[with]_technical_references.md](./5_[with]_technical_references.md)
   - External documentation resources
   - Technology stack references
   - API documentation links
   - Learning resources

## Practical Guides

Hands-on guides for specific aspects of development and contribution:

- **GitHub Repository Management**
  - [Sync Script Guide](/docs/guides/github/sync_script_guide.md) - How to use the sync script for repository updates
  - Repository URL: [https://github.com/sirfulga/journal-app](https://github.com/sirfulga/journal-app)
  - Contribution guidelines: [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/sirfulga/journal-app/CONTRIBUTING.md)

- **Development Environment** (Coming Soon)
  - Expo setup and configuration
  - React Native development environment
  - TensorFlow Lite integration

## Reference Documentation

Technical reference materials (coming soon):

- **React Native** - Component architecture, navigation, and styling
- **Expo** - Environment setup, workflow, and SDK features
- **TensorFlow Lite** - Model integration, optimization, and usage
- **JavaScript/TypeScript** - Coding standards and practices

## Project Status and Current Focus

The Journal App is currently in the early planning and documentation phase. The initial focus is on developing a Minimum Testable Product (MTP) that demonstrates core functionality. Key tasks in progress:

- Setting up GitHub repository and sync mechanisms
- Documenting project vision, specifications, and technical approach
- Planning initial implementation of core features
