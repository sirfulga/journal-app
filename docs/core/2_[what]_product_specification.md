## 3. Technical Implementation

### Technology Stack

| Category | Tools/Technologies | Rationale |
|----------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Frontend** | React Native, Expo | Cross-platform development with native performance |
| **AI** | TensorFlow Lite | On-device processing for privacy and offline functionality |
| **Database** | Local storage with encryption | Privacy-first approach with secure data storage |
| **State Management** | Context API or lightweight alternative | Appropriate for app complexity |
| **UI Components** | Custom components with consistent design system | Tailored user experience |

### On-Device AI Processing

TensorFlow Lite will be used for core AI features (see [context.md](./context.md) for details):
- Grammar and punctuation correction
- Text formatting assistance
- Identification of thoughts, goals, objectives, and tasks

This approach ensures:
- User privacy through on-device processing
- Offline functionality
- Reduced cloud processing costs

Premium features requiring more advanced language models may leverage cloud processing with clear user consent.

### Multi-Language Consideration

- Initial development will focus on a single language (English)
- Multi-language support will be evaluated based on TensorFlow Lite capabilities
- See [context.md](./context.md) for detailed multi-language implementation plans
