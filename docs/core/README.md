# Core Documentation

This directory contains the fundamental documentation that defines the Journal App project's purpose, specifications, technical approach, and development roadmap.

## Document Listing

| Document | Concept |
|----------|---------|
| [0_atlas.md](./0_atlas.md) | ATLAS |
| [1_[why]_purpose.md](./1_[why]_purpose.md) | WHY |
| [2_[what]_product_specification.md](./2_[what]_product_specification.md) | WHAT |
| [3_[how]_context.md](./3_[how]_context.md) | HOW |
| [4_[when]_action_plan.md](./4_[when]_action_plan.md) | WHEN |
| [5_[with]_technical_references.md](./5_[with]_technical_references.md) | WITH |

## Conceptual Ordering

The documentation follows a deliberate progression from high-level concepts to implementation details:

1. **WHY** - Start with purpose and vision
2. **WHAT** - Define the product and features
3. **HOW** - Determine the approach and implementation
4. **WHEN** - Plan the timeline and development process
5. **WITH** - Identify the tools and resources

## How to Use These Documents

These documents should be used in sequence to understand the complete picture of the Journal App project:

1. Start with **1_[why]_purpose.md** to understand the foundational goals
2. Move to **2_[what]_product_specification.md** to see what features will be implemented
3. Read **3_[how]_context.md** to understand how these will be implemented
4. Review **4_[when]_action_plan.md** to see the development timeline and tasks
5. Consult **5_[with]_technical_references.md** for implementation resources

Each document answers a fundamental question about the project:
- **1_[why]_purpose.md** answers "Why are we building this?"
- **2_[what]_product_specification.md** answers "What are we building exactly?"
- **3_[how]_context.md** answers "How should we build it?"
- **4_[when]_action_plan.md** answers "When will we build each component?"
- **5_[with]_technical_references.md** answers "With what tools and resources will we build it?"
